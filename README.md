# Port-Scanner
This project is a basic port scanner developed as part of the RISE Internship under the Cybersecurity &amp; Ethical Hacking domain. The scanner helps identify open ports on a target device (like a laptop or server) by trying to connect to them and seeing which ones respond.
The main reasons for making this scanner were:
To understand how basic port scanning works.
To get comfortable with Python networking modules.
To create both a command-line and web-based tool that students can use to experiment with.
To give us a hands-on example of how ethical hackers do basic reconnaissance.
Also, we wanted to build something that works fast, is simple to use, and is actually helpful in learning
cybersecurity concepts.
